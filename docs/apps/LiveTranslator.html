    <div class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</div>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application <strong>“LiveTranslator”</strong> (the “App”),
        developed and published by <strong>Beijing Zilolan Technology Co., Ltd.</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”).
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when using the App.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <li>User ID</li>
      <li>Account authentication tokens (for maintaining your login session)</li>

    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Subscription Information</h3>
    <p>
      If you purchase a subscription, Apple processes the payment and manages subscription status via your Apple ID.
      We may receive non-payment information related to your subscription status (e.g., whether you are subscribed) to unlock premium features.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store your full payment details (such as credit card numbers).
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Speech &amp; Text Data (Core Functionality)</h3>
    <p>
      LiveTranslator requires access to the device microphone to provide real-time speech recognition and translation.
      Depending on your settings and selected mode, the App processes audio and/or text to deliver translations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Microphone audio</strong> may be processed for speech recognition.</li>
      <li><strong>Recognized text</strong> may be processed for translation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not permanently store</strong> audio recordings, speech transcripts, or translation content on our servers.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Usage &amp; Diagnostics Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect limited, non-content technical information to improve stability and performance, such as:</p>

      <li>Performance metrics (e.g., latency, errors)</li>
      <li>Device and app version information (e.g., iOS version, App version)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Processing, Retention, and Storage</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Processing</h3>
    <p>
      Audio and text may be temporarily transmitted to third-party speech recognition or translation services to enable core functionality.
      These services process data only to provide the requested feature.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Retention</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not permanently store your audio recordings or translation content.</li>
      <li>Account information (email, user ID) is retained while your account remains active.</li>

    <h3>3.3 Security</h3>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information.
      No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to protect your data using industry-standard practices.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>We may share information only in the following limited cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With service providers needed to operate the App (e.g., speech/translation providers), solely to deliver requested functionality</li>
      <li>If required by law, regulation, legal process, or to protect rights and safety</li>
      <li>In connection with a business transfer (e.g., merger or acquisition), subject to appropriate safeguards</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Your information may be processed in countries other than your own, depending on where our servers and service providers operate.
      We take steps to ensure an appropriate level of protection for such transfers where required by law.
